Abstract—Early detection of sepsis—a critical, life-threatening
condition stemming from a dysregulated immune response to
infection—poses a significant challenge in healthcare. This paper
presents a novel augmented reality (AR) point-of-care system
specifically engineered to improve the prediction of early-stage
sepsis. By employing domain adaptation techniques alongside
advanced measurement algorithms, this system dynamically
analyzes patient data in real time. The intuitive AR inter-
face facilitates immediate clinical decision-making, potentially
enhancing patient outcomes and decreasing healthcare costs.
Additionally, this AR-based system democratizes sepsis detection
by incorporating visual aids and interactive elements, making it
easier to use compared to traditional methods like blood tests
and temperature assessments. This enhanced accessibility may
extend the system’s utility across diverse clinical environments
and remote areas
